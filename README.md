# AI Course – Practical Notebooks & Examples

This repository contains the **hands-on material** for an Artificial Intelligence course, covering **Deep Learning, Large Language Models, Generative AI, and Reinforcement Learning**.  
The content follows a **bottom-up approach**, from neural network fundamentals to advanced LLMs, diffusion models, and AI agents.

The repository is organized by **chapters**, each one aligned with the course syllabus and taught through practical Jupyter notebooks.
